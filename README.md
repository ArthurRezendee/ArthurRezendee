# üëã Hi, I'm Arthur ‚Äî Full-Stack Software Engineer

I design and build **scalable, data-driven systems** that connect back-end APIs, front-end applications, and intelligent or blockchain-based integrations ‚Äî primarily using **Node.js**, **Laravel**, and **Python (FastAPI)** as core back-end engines.

---

### üß† About Me
Full-stack engineer with strong expertise in **Node.js** ecosystems (NestJS, Express, TypeScript) and **modern API architectures**.  
My work combines **server-side logic**, **data pipelines**, and **AI-driven services**, supported by well-structured front-ends built in **React** and **Next.js**.

I focus on delivering **modular, reliable, and maintainable** code that scales across environments and integrates seamlessly with third-party services.
